**DroidWall v1.4.1** - September/08/2010
  * Fix segfault on newer devices.

  * **IMPORTANT: If you have DroidWall enabled and update to this version, please reboot your phone to flush old iptables rules. If you disable DroidWall before updating, this is not necessary.**

  * Much faster rules restore on reboot - fixes "not responding" and force close on start up
